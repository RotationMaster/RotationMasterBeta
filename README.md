# What does it do?

The basic inspiration for Rotation Master is to easilly be able to display a "cheat sheet" of your rotation over your runescape screen, instead of having to look at another screen.
You can set up your rotation in the window when it opens by adding new abilities and selecting from the dropdowns.

This idea expanded so you can now share rotations via a json file and the export/import buttons.

Then when you are happy you can position the overlay as you wish with the set ovelay position button and minimise the window.

You can cycle between rotations by pressing the main alt1 keybind (default alt + 1)

## Future Aims for the project:
- Better overlay notation, ability to add short notes for abilities such as keybinds, and change the ">" to a "+" if needed
- With the help of the [PVME Discord](https://discord.gg/pvme) I indent to populate some default rotations for popular bosses/loadouts and have them available in the app.
  
## Long term goals:
- If this project proves popular enough I will look at updating it to have dynamic cheat sheets so that once you activate an ability it fades slightly from the cheatsheet and highlights the next ability slightly.
